# Project Boost

## Notes/Takeaways
- Game Design Approach
    - This approach involves making levels with a feature in mind, that the level is designed around. For example:
        - flying under an obstacle
        - flying over an obstacle
        - flying past a moving obstacle
        - landing on a moving platform
        - slower/faster rocket
        - darker level
        - closer camera
        - bigger rocket (carrying something)
        - reversed controls
        - etc.
